The perpose of this project is to build a model and observe the performance of the activation function applying on it. We used keras layers. This is a sequntial models. We use six idfferent types of activation function. The list is: relu, sigmpid, leakyrelu, softmax, swish and tanh.

### Description of the dataset

The dataset is a shape of 398 x 9. This is mean that the dataset has 398 samples and 9 features. The features are: MPG,Cylinders,Displacement,Horsepower,Weight,Acceleration,Model Year,Origin,Car Name. 
- mpg -> fuel efficiency measured in miles per gallon (mpg)
- cylinders -> number of cylinders in the engin
- displacement -> displace of the engin
- horse power -> engin horse power
- weight -> vehicle weight
- acceleration -> time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph
- model year -> model year
- origin -> origin of the car. here 1 for americans, 2 for european and 3 for japanese
- car name is for carname
